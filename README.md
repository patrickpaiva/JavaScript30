# Wesbos' JavaScript30

This is a repository made during Wesbos' JavaScript30 Course. With this 30 simple projects, Wesbos teaches
a lot of useful things that will help me with Vanilla JavaScript.

It was part of my preparation after studying JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures. This challenge was 
very enlightening and iÂ´m sure this will make my journey much easier when comes the time for studying React.JS 
and Node.JS.

I'll leave the link if you want to try it! [Link](https://javascript30.com/)
